Changelog
=========

.. hint::
    What "previous revision ID" means? 
    If you are updating the package that never was stamped with 
    alembic you may need to stamp the database manually with following revision id, 
    from this point onwards you will be able to update schemas automaticly.
    Alembic 0.3.3+ (or current trunk for 2012-05-27) is required for this to function properly
